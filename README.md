# ST1506 : DATA STRUCTURE AND DIGITAL ANALYTICS FINAL YEAR PROJECT

# Synopsis
This repository is to host the full FYP project that contributing members did for this module during Year 3 Semester 1 in Singapore Polytechnic DIT Course. There will be no more further updates with effect from 30/8/2021 and its main purpose is just to serve as an archive.

<span style="color:red"> **NOTE:** With effect from 30/8/2021, the `windows` branch is depreciated. Please refrain from pushing or pulling from that branch.</span>

# Jupyter Notebooks
Here are the relatively breakthrough training notebooks that we have experimented with the entire project.
1. [NLP_BERT](./training/NLP_BERT.ipynb)
2. [NLP_MLP_Multilabel](./training/NLP_MLP_Multilabel.ipynb)
3. [NLP_VDCNN_Multilabel](./training/NLP_VDCNN_Multilabel.ipynb)
